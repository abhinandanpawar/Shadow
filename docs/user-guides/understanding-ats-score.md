# User Guide: Understanding Your ATS Score

One of the most powerful features of our platform is the **ATS Score**. This guide explains what it is, how it works, and how you can use it to get your resume past automated filters and into the hands of a human recruiter.

## What is an ATS?

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is software used by many companies to manage the hiring process. When you apply for a job online, your resume is often first read by an ATS, not a person. The ATS scans your resume for specific keywords, skills, and formatting to determine if you are a good match for the job.

If the ATS determines you are not a good match, your resume may be filtered out before a recruiter ever sees it.

## What is Your ATS Score?

Our platform's ATS Score is a real-time metric that estimates how well your resume is optimized for these automated systems. It is calculated by comparing the content of your resume against the text of the job description you are targeting.

The score, presented as a percentage, represents the **match rate** between your resume and the job description. A higher score means your resume is more likely to be seen favorably by an ATS.

## How to Improve Your ATS Score

Improving your score is a key step in tailoring your resume for a specific job application. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### **1. Add the Job Description**
The score can only be calculated if you provide a job description. Copy the full text of the job description you are applying for and paste it into the "Job Description" field in the editor.

### **2. Review Keyword Gaps**
Once the score is calculated, the platform will show you a list of **"Keyword Gaps"**.
-   **Found Keywords:** These are important terms from the job description that were successfully found in your resume. Great job!
-   **Missing Keywords:** These are important terms from the job description that the system could not find in your resume.

Your goal is to incorporate the "Missing Keywords" into your resume **naturally**. Do not just list them. Weave them into your summary or work experience bullet points where they make sense.

**Example:** If a missing keyword is "SQL," you could change a bullet point from "Managed a large customer database" to "Managed a large customer database using **SQL** to generate weekly reports."

### **3. Use AI Suggestions**
Our AI Assistant is trained to help with this. Click the "Improve with AI" button next to your work experience bullet points. The AI will often suggest new phrasings that naturally include the missing keywords and align your accomplishments with the job description.

### **4. Check for Formatting Issues**
Our ATS checker also looks for formatting that can confuse automated systems. If it flags an issue (e.g., an unsupported font or complex table), consider switching to a more "ATS-Friendly" template from our template gallery. These templates are specifically designed with clean, single-column layouts that parse reliably.

By following these steps, you can significantly increase your ATS score, giving you the best possible chance of landing an interview.
